Droid is a 3D printing related Grasshopper Plug-in Library add-on, with control over model Slicing, Custom paths and Gcode generation.
Designed to be used from small desktop 3d Printers, up to large scale Robotic Fabricators using FFF technologies and running from Gcode.
Available to be used to prepare and print models in a 'Plug and Play' style with Droid components, or in a more controlled and experimental manner with Custom input and output print paths.

Droid allows control over conventional Slicing features such as infill, shell thickness and caps, within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment. In addition, output and editing of paths is also available once models are sliced into the Rhino and Grasshopper workspace, allowing full control and analysis to the user.
Custom or edited paths then can be input back into Droid for Gcode preparation and generation.
